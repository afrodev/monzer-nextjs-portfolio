# **AI-Powered ESP32 Security Camera**  

## **Project Overview**  
This project is a **smart surveillance system** built using an **ESP32-CAM** with a motion sensor. The goal is to create an efficient and cost-effective security solution that **activates only when movement is detected**. Instead of continuously streaming video, which can drain power and storage, the system intelligently **triggers recording and notifications** when motion is detected.


## **Features & Technology Stack**  
- âœ… **ESP32-CAM** â€“ Captures real-time video  
- âœ… **PIR Motion Sensor** â€“ Detects movement and activates the camera  
- âœ… **Wi-Fi Connectivity** â€“ Sends alerts and streams video over the network  
- âœ… **REST API with .NET Backend** â€“ Stores logs and manages access  
- âœ… **Cloud & Local Storage Options** â€“ Save footage securely  
- âœ… **Mobile-Friendly Web Interface** â€“ View live feeds from anywhere  

## **Project Workflow**  
1. **Motion Detection**: The PIR sensor detects movement and wakes up the ESP32-CAM.  
2. **Video Capture & Processing**: The camera records or takes snapshots, optimizing for storage.  
3. **Cloud & API Communication**: The captured footage is either stored locally or uploaded to a cloud service.  
4. **User Notifications**: The system sends an alert to the user (email, mobile app, or SMS).  
5. **Web Dashboard**: A .NET-powered interface allows users to access footage, control settings, and monitor activity logs.  

## **Challenges & Solutions**  
- âš¡ **Power Management**: ESP32 consumes power even in deep sleep mode. I optimized the wake-up triggers to reduce energy use.  
- ðŸ“¡ **Network Latency**: Streaming over Wi-Fi caused delays, so I implemented **compressed snapshots** for faster transmission.  
- ðŸ”’ **Security**: Added **end-to-end encryption** and authentication for secure access.  

## **Future Enhancements**  
- ðŸš€ **AI-Based Object Detection**: Differentiate between humans, animals, and false triggers.  
- ðŸ“¶ **5G / LoRa Support**: Improve connectivity in remote areas.  
- ðŸ”‹ **Battery & Solar Power**: Make it a truly wireless, self-sustained system.  

This project blends **IoT, AI, and software development** to create a **smart, efficient security solution**. It's a great example of how embedded systems can **enhance everyday life** with automation and intelligence.

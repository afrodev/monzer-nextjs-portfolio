# **Bobabike: Revolutionizing Street Food in Oslo**

## **Project Overview**
At just 19 years old, I launched Bobabikeâ€”a first-of-its-kind mobile bubble tea shop operated entirely from a custom-built electric cargo bike. This innovative business combined my passion for entrepreneurship, sustainability, and bringing new experiences to Oslo's food scene. All while beating out the competition in prices!

## **The Concept & Execution**
The idea was simple yet bold: import an electric cargo bike from China to Norway, transform it into a fully functional kitchen, and cycle it around Oslo serving fresh bubble tea. I had run the numbers and it seemed profitable on paper but I couldn't believe it. So I asked an accountant and he said mockingly "These numbers are a bit idealistic and if you actually manage to make it, let me know". What made this venture unique was the complete mobility and zero emissions approachâ€”a truly sustainable food business.

## **Business Development & Challenges**

### **Sourcing & Customization**
- âœ… **Researched and imported** a specialized electric cargo bike from China
- âœ… **Designed and built** a compact kitchen setup that met Norwegian food safety regulations
- âœ… **Created custom branding** that would stand out in Oslo's competitive food scene

### **Operations & Marketing**
- âœ… **Developed efficient workflows** for preparing bubble tea in a tiny mobile kitchen
- âœ… **Implemented guerrilla marketing strategies** using only social media and influencer partnerships
- âœ… **Mapped optimal routes** through Oslo to maximize customer engagement
- âœ… **Managed all aspects** of the business including hiring, staff training, accounting, and logistics

### **Results**
The business was an immediate success, selling out inventory every day of operation. The unique concept generated significant buzz in Oslo, with customers often lining up to experience the novel concept of buying bubble tea from a bike.

## **Key Learnings**

### **Business Insights**
- ðŸ’¡ **Uniqueness sells**: The novelty of the concept was as much a draw as the product itself
- ðŸ’¡ **Location flexibility** is a massive advantage in food service
- ðŸ’¡ **Sustainable business models** resonate strongly with younger demographics
- ðŸ’¡ **Social media marketing** can be extremely effective with zero budget when the concept is photogenic

### **Personal Growth**
This project pushed me to develop skills across multiple domains:
- ðŸš€ **Supply chain management** - sourcing internationally during challenging times
- ðŸš€ **Regulatory navigation** - working with food safety authorities to approve a non-traditional setup
- ðŸš€ **Physical endurance** - cycling a heavy cargo bike throughout Oslo in all weather conditions
- ðŸš€ **Time management** - balancing all aspects of the business as a solo entrepreneur

## **Impact & Legacy**
Bobabike demonstrated that sustainable, mobile food businesses can thrive in urban environments. The project received attention not just for its product but for reimagining what a food business could look like in an increasingly environmentally-conscious market.

Though Bobabike operated for a limited season, it proved the concept's viability and provided invaluable entrepreneurial experience that continues to influence my approach to business and innovation today.

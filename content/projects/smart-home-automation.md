# Smart Home Automation System

## Overview
This project combines Arduino microcontrollers and Raspberry Pi to create a comprehensive home automation system. The system controls lighting, temperature, and security through a user-friendly web interface.

## Technical Challenges

### Hardware Integration
One of the biggest challenges was integrating various sensors and actuators with different protocols. We solved this by:

- Creating a unified communication protocol
- Implementing a message queue system
- Developing custom PCB boards for sensor nodes

### Software Architecture
The software stack includes:

- Node.js backend for the main server
- React-based frontend for the control interface
- MQTT for device communication
- InfluxDB for time-series data storage

## Implementation Details

### Core Features
1. **Automated Climate Control**
   - Temperature and humidity monitoring
   - Smart thermostat integration
